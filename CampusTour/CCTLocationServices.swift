 This file houses the Campus Tour location services, CTLocationServices,
 class.  CTLS (Campus Tour Location Services) periodically reads the
 current GPS position and invokes the specified delegate when a new
 reading becomes available.
 Initialize with an update interval in seconds and a delegate object.
 The delegate object must be derived from a class that implements the
 CLLocationManagerDelegate interface.  For example:
 
 class ViewController: UIViewController, CLLocationManagerDelegate
 
 The delegate must implement at least 2 of the interfaces stipulated
 by the CLLocationManagerDelegate interface: didUpdateLocations and
 didFailWithError.  The function stubs are
 
 func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager,
 didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) { }
 
 and
 
 func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager,
 didFailWithError error: Error) { }


 Your application should update the "Privacy - Location When In Use Usage
 Description" subkey in the project Info.plist.  This is a subkey of
 the "Information Property List" key.  A suggested value for this
 subkey is "This App needs your location to deliver information about
 your location on campus."  If the subkey does not exist, it should
 be added under the "Information Property List" key.

     The internal CTLS timer start automatically when init() executes.
     However, the timer can be stopped by a call to stopTimer() and can be
     restarted by calling startTimer().  If the timer is already running,
     this function simply unpauses it, if it is paused.  Otherwise, the
     function has no effect.  Use the stop/start functions to change the
     CTLS timer interval.  To simply pause the retrieval of new GPS data
     w/o starting/stopping the periodic timer, use the pause() and
     unpause() functions.

     Whereas the start/stop timer functions start and stop the timer, which in
     turn, halts location services, pausing/unpausing the CTLS allows the timer
     loop to continue, but when the system is paused, location services are not
     invoked.  This reduces batter consumption and should be used while a CT
     video is playing.  This could also be used if the user decides to manually
     pause the application.
