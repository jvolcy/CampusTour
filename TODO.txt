- poi status needs to be stored on the individual devices (core data)

- version #s need to be added with a corresponding label in the "About" view

- currently works with mp4 and rtf only.  Support for jpg and mp3 is needed.  The envisioned implementation is as follows:
1) the rtf is required.  load it and display it.  do nothing if it is not found.
2) search for an mp4.  If one is found, play it.  We're done.
3) if no mp4 is found, look for a jpg.  If it is found display it.  Otherwise, display a default photo.
4) look for an mp3.  If one is found, play it.


- poi status needs to be implemented:
1) initially, all poi have a status of "NotVisited"
2) once media for a poi begins to play, that poi should be marked as "Visited"
3) when the media finishes playing, the poi should be marked as "Completed"

- the checkmark graphic needs to reflect the poi status

- stub files for JPG, RTF and MP3 needed

- must pre-load POI RTFs to make map navigation fast.

- joystick controls should disappear when we are not in debug mode

- need to create some hidden way to switch to debug mode
