- poi status needs to be stored on the individual devices (core data)

- version #s need to be added with a corresponding label in the "About" view

- currently works with mp4 and rtf only.  Support for jpg and mp3 is needed.  The envisioned implementation is as follows:
1) the rtf is required.  load it and display it.  do nothing if it is not found.
2) search for an mp4.  If one is found, play it.  We're done.
3) if no mp4 is found, look for a jpg.  If it is found display it.  Otherwise, display a default photo.
4) look for an mp3.  If one is found, play it.

- stub files for JPG, MP4 and MP3 needed

- need to create some hidden way to switch to debug mode

- the tour picker on the home screen should be populated from an on-line source
