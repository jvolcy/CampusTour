- poi status needs to be stored on the individual devices (core data)

- version #s need to be added with a corresponding label in the "About" view

- currently works with mp4 and rtf only.  Support for jpg and mp3 is needed.  The envisioned implementation is as follows:
1) the rtf is required.  load it and display it.  do nothing if it is not found.
2) search for an mp4.  If one is found, play it.  We're done.
3) if no mp4 is found, look for a jpg.  If it is found display it.  Otherwise, display a default photo.
4) look for an mp3.  If one is found, play it.

- stub files for JPG, MP4 and MP3 needed

- need to create some hidden way to switch to debug mode

- the tour picker on the home screen should be populated from an on-line source

- campus map needs to be rotated to reflect pedestrian heading

- need to have multiple satellite coordinates w/ smaller radii for the same POI; POI file needs to have a new designation: "DO_NOT_EDIT" for satellite coordinates.  This designation would be used for the title and URLs.  Only the URL of the main POI should be used.

- need to use the horizontalAccuracy: CLLocationAccuracy member of the CLLocation to change the transparency or image used by the marker

- failure testing
test when location is not available (or user declines)
test when camera is not available (or user declines)
test when network is not available
test when GPS is not available
test when compass/gyro is not available

The function getImageOffsetInImageView() probably needs work
